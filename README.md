**Meta Viewport Adder** was created to solve a problem I had when using my favorite browser *Firefox*, my goal is not to dedicate myself to add features in the short or long term.

If **you** want to add any feature, improve the code, etc; you can feel free to do so.

If there is a **native** way to do it in Firefox (such as about:config), please notify me and I will remove it.
